2005-12-11 08:51:54 - The fashion world as a form of terrorism<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Well, there's a tyranny to the fashion world in the way it extols an ideal beauty above all else that I think damages us. That has been a form of torture for women for decades and now it's increasingly happening to men. This obsession with looks that the fashion and photography worlds have taken to an extreme, psychically damages the culture. Period. That's a fact. I know we're not talking about actual violence--which is the terrorists goal--but emotional violence. Both worlds want you to be emotionally violated in the end.&quot;<br/>
